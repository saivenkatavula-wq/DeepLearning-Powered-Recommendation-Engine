# Recommendation System

This repository contains an implementation of a Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and item similarities.

## Overview

The project includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Modeling**: Implementing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.
5. **Prediction**: Generating recommendations for users.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   Open the `Recommendation_system.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to execute each cell.

## Usage

### Data Loading

1. **Load the dataset**:
   ```python
   # Code to load and preprocess the dataset
   ```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Analyze the dataset**:
   ```python
   # Code for exploratory data analysis
   ```

### Modeling

1. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   ```python
   # Code to implement collaborative filtering
   ```

2. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   ```python
   # Code to implement content-based filtering
   ```

### Evaluation

1. **Evaluate the models**:
   ```python
   # Code to evaluate the models' performance
   ```

### Prediction

1. **Generate recommendations**:
   ```python
   # Code to generate recommendations for users
   ```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the trained model to generate recommendations:

```python
user_id = 1
recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id)
print('Recommendations:', recommendations)
```
